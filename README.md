Traditional hello world fro Github

I am a Web Developer, I love learning new useful programming 
languages and techniques. 
My name is Miguel Angel, I am currently developing in Angular,
React, Node, and also somo apps in Android.
In the future I would like to learn about AI and Machine Learning.
I am going to make some online stores and course platforms
either in React or Angular.

I come from a php background, as a matter of fact I taught myself
php, so I am also gonna make a store in Laravel.

With Node I want to make Desktop Apps.

There's a lot more I am gonna learn
